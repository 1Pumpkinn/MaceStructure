  # The plugin never modifies terrain. Instead it scans the full 3D volume
  # the structure would occupy and rejects the location if solid blocks are
  # found inside it. This prevents the structure from spawning inside a hill.
  # On relaxation rounds the allowed ratio loosens slightly (max 0.15 by round 3),
  # permitting a small number of stray leaves/logs that poke into the volume.

  # No platform — structure sits directly on terrain

    enabled: false

  # Flat, open INLAND biomes only.
  # forest and birch_forest removed — they frequently generate on coastal
  # cliffs right next to ocean, causing the bad-looking placements.
